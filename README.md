# tic-tac-toe-tkinter
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe (X/O) desktop game built with Python and Tkinter.

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe (X/O) game, developed in two versions: a terminal-based version and a graphical user interface version using Tkinter. The game includes all the core mechanics such as turn management between two players, validation of moves, automatic win detection, and draw detection when the board is full.

The project was built step by step as a learning exercise to better understand Python programming, game logic, and basic GUI development. It starts with a simple console-based implementation to focus on the core logic, then evolves into a complete graphical version with an interactive interface, buttons, and visual feedback for the players.
